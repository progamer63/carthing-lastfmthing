# about:
this project is an idea to have a decent recreation of the spotify car thing UI as a single page web page that can then be used via something like [superbird-debian-kiosk](https://github.com/bishopdynamics/superbird-debian-kiosk)  
though, that does require additional hardware, so hopefully eventuallyTM people figure out how to run chromium on-device by replacing the stock UI itself  
since i mainly mess around in python + html/css, this probably won't be the best thing ever
# basic setup:
requries you to have a lastfm account & link it to spotify  
modify fetch.js "let user = '\<user\>';" to be your username
# misc:
i don't mind if you open issues or pull requests to improve something
# work list:
- background to be not a gradient (really want it to be the background image super blurred to have a changing color background like actual car thing)
- add controls that work? maybe?
